writeFile ex1.txt "hello\nworld"   creates ("hello\nworld") file on filepath (ex1.txt).
readFile :: FilePath -> IO String

using a <- we can extract the type from an IO.
contents <- getLine, gives the string.

return is tricky, It is badly named and there is an alternative that works exactly the same known as "pure". insted of return use pure.
To minimize confusion.
